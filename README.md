# **Hardhat-demo**

#### This repository contains a sample project demonstrating following things done using [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) :

1. Deployment of contract to default `hardhat-network` and also on `ganache`.
2. Debugging `Solidity` contract using `hardhat/console.log`.
3. Testing using `chai` library with and without using `mocha-hooks`.
